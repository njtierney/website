An outline of the scientific programme can now be found on the [Programme tab](https://user2018.r-project.org/scientific/). Titles for keynote talks will be completed as we get them. Based on the frequency of accepted abstract keywords, the parallel sessions will be organised (roughly) into six main themes, applications, models, algorithms, visualisation, community/education, bioinformatics. Thursday's dinner programme will feature a short talk by John Mertic of the R Consortium about the funding available for open source projects. There will also be a trivia contest with lots of books as prizes, donated by CRC Press, and Springer.
