Do you want to present a talk, poster or lightning talk at useR! 2018?  You can [submit an abstract here](https://goo.gl/forms/fWETwXsdfMbkFhJD3). Deadline for abstract submission is Mar 2.

Abstracts will be reviewed on a rolling basis, with three acceptance rounds, approx first week of Feb, third week of Feb, and first week of Mar (before early registration deadline). If there are sufficient quality submissions on a topic a session will be formed early, and authors notified. The earlier you submit, the higher the acceptance rate.
