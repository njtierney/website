Want to give a tutorial at useR! 2018? You can submit a proposal at https://goo.gl/forms/RR4UgCnMrgIiLJDk1. 

Tutorials are typically half day. We are planning on being able to cover reasonable travel costs of tutorial presenters. The deadline for submitting a proposal is Jan 15, 2018. Notification of proposal success will be early Feb. 

The examples of past tutorials are outlined in [useR! 2017 Tutorials](https://user2017.brussels/tutorials), which weâ€™d like to see again.
