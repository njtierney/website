Do you need some financial help getting to useR! 2018? If so, [apply for a scholarship](https://goo.gl/forms/ouNyaldzn95957j32). We have funding to provide a few scholarships already, and still hoping for getting more funding to award more. In addition R Ladies Melbourne are offering two $500 travel scholarships! Decisions on scholarships will be based on potential positive impact on the community of the applicant's participation, encouraging diversity to balance participant demographics for a supportive environment, economic need, and available funds for scholarships.
