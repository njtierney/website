# Airport

The closest airport is [Brisbane International Airport](http://www.bne.com.au). Twenty eight airlines fly directly into and out of Brisbane, including Qantas, Virgin Australia, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific Airways, China Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Korean Airlines, Thai Airways, Air Canada, and Air New Zealand.

The airport is serviced by Brisbaneâ€™s airport rail link, [Airtrain](https://airtrain.com.au), which provides a cost effective and efficient service to travellers transferring to the City and the Convention Centre. Getting around the city by the ferry and bus is done using [translink](https://translink.com.au) with a GO card (reduced fare). 

International visitors most likely will need a visa to enter Australia. Information on the type of visa to get can be found on the [Australian Department of Immigration and Boarder visitor information website](http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/Trav/Visi/Visi). They can provide advice if needed. The Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) may be the best option.
