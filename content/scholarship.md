There will be a few scholarships available for travel to useR! 2018. We don't yet know how many.  If you would like to apply for a scholarship please complete the [application form](https://goo.gl/forms/ouNyaldzn95957j32). We expect to make some awards before the early registraton deadline, but if more sponsorship funding comes in we may be able to offer more at later dates. Decisions on scholarships will be based on potential positive impact on the community of the applicant's participation, encouraging diversity to balance participant demographics for a supportive environment, economic need, and available funds for scholarships.

In addition, there are *two [R Ladies Melbourne](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-Melbourne/) scholarships* of $500 each, which may be awarded on top of another scholarship or separately. Please tick the box if you would like to be considered for these awards.
