    In this tutorial we will learn how to estimate disease risk and quantify risk factors using areal and geostatistical data. We will also create interactive maps of disease risk and risk factors, and introduce presentation options such as interactive dashboards and shiny apps. We will work through two disease mapping examples using data of malaria in the Gambia and cancer in Pennsylvania, United States. We will focus on disease risk, but the approaches covered are also applicable to other fields such as climate, ecology or crime. We will cover the following topics:

      <ul>
      <li> Model disease risk in different settings
      <li> Manipulate and transform point, areal and raster data using the spatial packages `sp`, `spdep`, `raster`, `rgdal`, `geoR`, `SpatialEpi` and `SpatialEpiApp`,
      <li> Retrieve high resolution spatially referenced environmental data using `raster`,
      <li> Fit and interpret spatial models using `INLA`,
      <li> Map disease risk and risk factors using `leaflet` and `ggplot2`,
      <li> Communicate results with interactive dashboards using `flexdashboard` and shiny apps using `shiny`.
      </ul>

  <tr class="collapse out budgets 71collapsed">
    <td colspan="4"><p>
    The class of generalized linear models encompasses many tools commonly used in data analysis, including multiple linear regression, logistic regression, log-linear models, etc. But a linear predictor does not always capture the relationship we wish to model. Rather, a nonlinear predictor may provide a better description of the observed data, often with fewer and more interpretable parameters. This tutorial introduces the wider class of generalized nonlinear models (GNMs) and their implementation via the R package `gnm`.

    We will present some real-world data science scenarios and use these as a basis to walk participants through the process of building and deploying R-docker apps. Participants will gain experience in writing R scripts to run as stand-alone docker applications through examples, discussion and activities. We will provide code that can be used as a basis for participants' own projects.

  In this tutorial we will explore several "advanced" scenarios of using Docker and R together to ease deployment of R applications. Attendees will gain hands-on experience building and deploying docker images for Shiny, databases, plumber, and keras. We will also look at cloud deployment and scaling applications with Kubernetes.

    This hands-on tutorial will help beginner-to-intermediate R users take their data wrangling skills to the next level with an introduction to the Tidyverse: a collection of data science packages including dplyr, tidyr, purrr, ggplot2, and more. Using provided data sets and practical examples, you will learn how to efficiently import, tidy, and transform data to more quickly focus on tasks like visualization and modeling.

    The ability to easily collect and gather a large amount of data from different sources can be seen as an opportunity to better understand many processes. It has already led to breakthroughs in several application areas. However, due to the wide heterogeneity of measurements and objectives, these large databases often exhibit an extraordinary high number of missing values. Hence, in addition to scientific questions, such data also present some important methodological and technical challenges for data analyst. In this tutorial, we give an overview of the missing values literature as well as the recent improvements that caught the attention of the community due to their ability to handle large matrices with large amount of missing entries. We will illustrate the methods on medical, environmental and survey data.

    This tutorial teaches practical workflows for creating interactive web graphics which support common data analysis tasks. Through a series of examples, demos, exercises, and lecture, attendees will gain a foundation for navigating through common barriers of productivity associated with both the creation (e.g. start-up cost, iteration cost, dead-end cost) and distribution (e.g., deployment cost, scaling cost, latency cost) of interactive web graphics.

The attendees should have a basic understanding of regression models and of the basic concepts underlying statistics and machine learning (e.g. probability densities, quantiles, etc).</td>
