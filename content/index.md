## Location

Brisbane is the capital city of Queensland. The temperature in June/July is a comfortable 21C, on average, and it is the ideal time to visit the tropical north including the Great Barrier Reef. There are direct flights to Brisbane from Asia, the Middle East, Pacific nations and the USA. An extensive public transport network makes it possible to access the city centre from Brisbane suburbs, and the Gold Coast, by train, bus or ferry. The Brisbane hinterland includes World Heritage National Parks, the world famous Australia Zoo, and amazing beaches.
